  3.Get a list of city names from station with even ID numbers only. Exclude duplicates from your answer.[table: station]
  
  SELECT id, CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 0;

4. Find the difference between the total number of city entries in the table and the number of distinct city entries in the table. In other words, if N is the number of city entries in station, and N1 is the number of distinct city names in station, write a query to find the value of N-N1 from station.
[table: station]
SELECT COUNT(CITY)- COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;

*5. Answer the following
a. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates. [Hint: Use RIGHT() / LEFT() methods ]

select distinct city from station where city LIKE 'A%'
or city LIKE 'E%'
OR city LIKE 'I%'
OR city LIKE 'O%'
OR city LIKE 'U%'
OR city LIKE 'a%'
OR city LIKE 'e%'
OR city LIKE 'i%'
OR city LIKE 'o%'
OR city LIKE 'u%';

 same question with another naswer
 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U');
 
  b. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates
  
  SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U') AND SUBSTRING(REVERSE(CITY),1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U');

c. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U');

d. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates. [table: station]

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT in('A','E','I','O','U') OR SUBSTRING(REVERSE(CITY),1,1) NOT in('A','E','I','O','U');

6. Write a query that prints a list of employee names having a salary greater than $2000 per month who have been employed for less than 36 months. Sort your result by descending order of salary. [table: emp]

SELECT first_name ,salary FROM Emp
WHERE salary > 2000 AND month(hire_date)<36
ORDER BY salary desc;

7. How much money does the company spend every month on salaries for each department? [table: employee]

select deptno, sum(salary) as Total_salary from employee
group by deptno;

8. How many cities in the CITY table have a Population larger than 100000. [table: city]

select name as City,population from city
where population > 100000
order by population desc;


9. What is the total population of California? [table: city]
